I am Vignesh, exploring Git Hub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is an open-source application that allows users to interact with GitHub using a graphical user interface (GUI)
instead of a command line or web browser.
It is free to use and is designed to simplify workflows and improve collaboration for developers.

GitHub Desktop has a structured user interface with a button for each Git command.
It hides much of the Git plumbing from the user, so developers can focus on the porcelain.
